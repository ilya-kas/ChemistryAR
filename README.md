My course project that became my graduating project. 
 There is a user's mobile device with an android application installed. There are also printed element cards (reference images). The user lays out several of them in front of him, points the camera in the application and a model of the corresponding atom appears above the element. The card can be moved, rotated - the model moves after it. Having compiled several cards together, if the valences match, the elements are combined into a molecule. If some atom is superfluous, it remains in place, and the rest are combined. If you take the card away, the molecule breaks back into individual atoms.
In development:
  A network of devices is created (albeit through a mobile hotspot). Their virtual worlds are merged to help track more items at once. Elements are already combined into molecules, but now these molecules can be linked to one of the maps and by combining the molecules, reactions can be carried out. Accordingly, animations occur, inscriptions appear.
